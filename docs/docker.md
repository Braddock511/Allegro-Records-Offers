This Docker Compose file creates three services - vueapp, api, and database. The vueapp service runs a Vue.js application, the api service runs a Python FastAPI server, and the database service runs a PostgreSQL database.

The vueapp service is built using the Dockerfile Dockerfile.vueapp. The image is based on the nginx image and is responsible for serving the frontend Vue.js application. The service is exposed on port 8080 and depends on the database and api services.

The api service is built using the Dockerfile Dockerfile.api. The image is based on the python:3.10.10-slim-buster image and installs the necessary requirements using pip. The service sets environment variables for the database and external APIs. The FastAPI server is started on port 80 and exposed to the host on port 8000. The service depends on the database service.

The database service runs the PostgreSQL database image and sets the necessary environment variables. The data for the database is stored in a volume named db_data.

Two networks are created - frontend_network and backend_network. The vueapp and api services are connected to both networks, while the database service is only connected to the backend_network.
